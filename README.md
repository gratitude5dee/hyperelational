üöÄ Introduction

Hyperelational is a next-generation Business Intelligence (BI) platform designed to move beyond traditional dashboards. It leverages a powerful relational foundation model, KumoRFM, to analyze deep, complex relationships within your data, providing predictive insights that were previously impossible to surface.

This isn't just about visualizing numbers; it's about understanding the intricate web of connections that drive your business. Whether you're in fashion e-commerce or the music & creative industry, Hyperelational offers a tailored experience to help you make smarter, data-driven decisions.

‚ú® Key Features

üåê Dual-Industry Focus: A tailored BI experience for both Fashion E-commerce (customer churn, LTV, trend forecasting) and Music & Touring (fan engagement, tour planning, merch insights).

ü§ñ AI Chat & PQL Generation: Converse with your data in natural language. Our AI assistant, powered by Groq and KumoRFM, translates your questions into Predictive Query Language (PQL) and provides narrative insights.

üîÆ Predictive Analytics: Go beyond historical data. Predict future outcomes like customer churn, sales forecasts, and market trends with confidence scores.

üï∏Ô∏è 3D Relational Graph Explorer: Visualize the complex relationships between your customers, products, fans, and events in an interactive 3D universe.

üß† Agent-Based Workflows: Deploy autonomous AI agents to perform complex tasks like ad campaign optimization, inventory management, and trend prediction.

üîå Seamless Integrations: One-click connections to your favorite platforms (Shopify, Google Analytics, Stripe, Spotify for Artists) to build a unified data model.

üéØ Dynamic Audience Builder: Create hyper-specific audience segments using both historical data and AI predictions for targeted marketing campaigns.

Supabase Backend: Built on a robust and scalable serverless backend using Supabase for database, authentication, and edge functions.

üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

Hyperelational is built with a modern, scalable architecture designed for real-time analytics and AI processing.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Local Development

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v18 or higher)

Bun (as a package manager)

Git

Supabase CLI

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

code
Sh
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd hyperelational-main-3

Install dependencies:

code
Sh
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
bun install

Set up Supabase locally:

Initialize Supabase within the project:

code
Sh
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
supabase init

Start the local Supabase services (this will spin up Docker containers):

code
Sh
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
supabase start

Apply the database migrations to your local instance. The -x flag is important to apply all schemas.

code
Sh
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
supabase db reset

Deploy the edge functions to your local instance:

code
Sh
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
supabase functions deploy

Configure Environment Variables:

Copy the example environment file:

code
Sh
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
cp .env.example .env.local

Run supabase status. This will output your local Supabase details.

Update .env.local with the following values from the supabase status output:

VITE_SUPABASE_URL: Your local API URL.

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Your local anon key.

You will also need to add Supabase service role key and other API keys for the functions to work correctly. Find the service_role key from the supabase status output.

# Supabase (frontend)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-local-anon-key

# Supabase Edge Functions (backend)
SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-local-service-role-key

# External Services
KUMO_API_KEY=your_kumorfm_api_key_or_mock
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_or_mock

Note: For local development, you can use placeholder strings for KUMO_API_KEY and GROQ_API_KEY as the edge functions have mock fallbacks.

Run the development server:

code
Sh
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
bun run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

üìÇ Application Structure

The project follows a standard Vite + React structure with a clear separation of concerns.
